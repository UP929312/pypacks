# Raycasting pack

This pack highlights raycasting, which allows for detection of blocks/entities when the player right clicks (or activates them another way)
Previously, this was all internally done, but now, you can create an instance of the Raycast class and configure it out you'd like.

This aims to be relatively optimised, however it still remains to be readable and maintainable.
