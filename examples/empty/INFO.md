# Empty Resource Pack

This is an empty resource pack. It contains no custom content.
It's purpose is to showcase the culling of unused content from the pack.
For example, the datapack no longer has a tick.json file, as it is not used, and is therefor not included.
This pack aims to be incredibly lightweight, and only contain the necessary files to function (which is does).
